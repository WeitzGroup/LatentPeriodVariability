# Code by Marian Dominguez-Mirazo and Jeremy Harris, 2024
# This function calculates the likelihood of multiple simulations given a timeseries dataset of viral and total host dynamics, and the standard error obtained from replicates.
# It returns a vector of likelihoods as large as the number of simulations
